SuperSimpleClock
================

Clock made in Java with Swing designed for use in a dark room (small white text on a black screen). Intended purpose is to use laptop as an alarm clock while on work travel for the creator(me!). Future functionality includes wav-playing alarm, darkened text after set time after startup, and possibly MP3 playing capabilities with planned translation to JavaFX.
